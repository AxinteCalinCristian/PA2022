<h2> Laboratory 4 </h2>
<ul>
  <li> <h3> Compulsory </h3> 
    <ul>
      <li> &#9989;  Create a Maven project.  </li> 
      <li>  &#9989; Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Streets have names and lengths, intersections have names. A street joins two intersections. </li> 
      <li>  &#9989; Create the streets and the intersections of the problem described in the example. Use streams in order to easily create the intersections.  </li> 
      <li>  &#9989; Create a list of streets, using LinkedList implementation and sort it by the length, using a comparator expressed as a lambda-expression or method reference. Make sure all the objects are comparable. </li> 
      <li> &#9989;  Create a set of intersections, using a HashSet implementation. Verify the property that a Set does not contain duplicates.  </li> 
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <h3> Homework </h3> 
     <ul>
      <li> &#9989; Create a class that describes the city. </li> 
      <li> &#9989; Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the streets that are longer than a specified value and join at least 3 streets. </li> 
      <li> &#9989; Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for intersections and streets.</li> 
      <li> &#11015; You may use this package of JGraphT in order to solve the problem (or other library). </li> 
      <li> &#9989; Note: A personal implementation of the algorithm will be will be scored extra (+1p). </li> 
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <h3> Bonus </h3> 
    <ul>
      <li> &#9989; The city hall wants to regularly inspect the surveillance cameras, sending a maintenance car to go through it all. </li> 
      <li> &#9989; Implement an algorithm that determines the route of the maintenance car, in order to minimize the total length. The algorithm must run fast and should not find a solution that is twice as bad than the optimum route. </li> 
      <li> &#9989; Create a random problem generator, making sure that the lengths between intersections satisfy the triangle inequality. </li> 
    </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
